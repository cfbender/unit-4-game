## About the game

Select your favorite character from Brandon Sanderson's famous *Stormlight Archive* and battle "king-of-the-hill" style to win! 

Each character has a unique HP, attack and counter-attack stat. When a character is selected as your own, you will use only the HP and attack stat. This attack will grow by the base attack after each attack.

After every attack, the opponent will counter attack with their counter-atk stat. Whoever hits 0 HP first loses!
